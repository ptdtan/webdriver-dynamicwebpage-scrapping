WebDriver-DynamicWebpage-Scrapping
==================================

I used to install Anaconda1.9, Python2.7 and Spyder2.25 to scrape thound soccer matches within few minutes. However I am not master in Python and feel that is not too user-friendly compare to R, but more efficient than R in webdriver. <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda>

```{r}...
# run the function to scrap the web content to be data frame
eng0910 = get_7M_matches(url0910,tz='GMT+0')
eng1011 = get_7M_matches(url1011,tz='GMT+0')
eng1112 = get_7M_matches(url1112,tz='GMT+0')
eng1213 = get_7M_matches(url1213,tz='GMT+0')
eng1314 = get_7M_matches(url1314,tz='GMT+0')
...```
